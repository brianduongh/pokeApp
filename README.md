# pokeApp

This is a project built for my friend who's thinking about starting a poke restaurant. It has a loading screen and a screen with tabs that navigates to other features.
It's a simple static UI project built to showcase to my friend what his app could look like.
This means there's no authentication flow and no other navigations besides the present screens.

<b>Set up</b>
1. Pull repository
2. react-native link
3. react-native run-ios

<b>Notes</b>
Since there is no authentication flow, to move pass the loading screen you need to click on the logo. This will bring you to the home screen.
